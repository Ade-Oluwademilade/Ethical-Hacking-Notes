If both the IPv4 and IPv6 is turned on and if you are utilizing IPv4 then whoâ€™s doing DNS for IPv6, the simple answer is usually nobody.

Now we will setup an attacker machine that will listen to IPv6 and represent itself as a DNS for it.

When we reboot the machine then a machine that reboot will triggers an event that event comes through to us. We can use that machine to login to the Domain Controller and it does not have to be an admin or anything and we can get information, a lot of information out of just that we can potentially use that machine to create another machine.
