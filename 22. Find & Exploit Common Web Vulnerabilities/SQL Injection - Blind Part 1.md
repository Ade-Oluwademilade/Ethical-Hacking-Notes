We are given this website together with the username and password, type in your creds which is `jeremy:jeremy`

We can intercept the traffic with `burpsuite` forward it 

If we navigate to **Proxy>>HTTP history** viewing the response of the request we forwarded we can see that we got a message that says **"Welcome to your Dashboard!"**
