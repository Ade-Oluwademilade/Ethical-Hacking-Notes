### What is a Stageless payload?

A stageless payload is the simplest type of payload to understand, it contains everything you will need to get a reverse shell callback. Because of this, the file size is typically much larger and the program is relatively complex compared to that of a staged. This payload can be caught by listening on a raw socket. You can create a listener in Netcat, Python, Socat, etc.
