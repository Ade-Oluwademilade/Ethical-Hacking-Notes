**What is XSS**
- XSS stands for Cross-site Scripting

	- **Reflected** - is where the script we are trying to inject comes from the current http request, it is somehow limited cos' it looks like we are only targeting ourselves
	- **Stored** - This one is much more powerful because our payload is stored in something like a database and then can be retrieved later
	- **DOM** -
