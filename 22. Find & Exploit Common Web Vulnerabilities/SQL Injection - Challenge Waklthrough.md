We have 2 ways to do this :D

Manually using the **UNION SELECT** query or using `sqlmap`

***

We are giving a product page with the search functionality

Using this query in the search bar - `senpai' or 1=1#` we got back all the lists of product

we can then advance our query by using **UNION SELECT**, like we said in the past modules, keep adding `null` till something clicks

```
senpai' union select null,null,null#
```
