## **When to Use?**

If IPv6 is not possible in a network and we do want to compromise an account, well, this tool is a **"TO-GO"** for us.

## **Example Usage**

**Note:**Â LDAP requires a bind credential -- can be a low-level domain user -- in order to connect to the LDAP service and run queries.

```shell
# Make a directory

```
