We are given a website with almost no functionality except we sign up , and then login with the account created

We did sign up as user `bankai` , and then logged in

## **Vulnerability Detection**

Decided to run a directory bruteforce and only `/admin` looks interesting

Navigating to `/admin` we get this error

**Tip ðŸ’¡ :** If you don't have access to a particular directory on a website, we can try to fuzz what is inside that directory and see if we have direct access, here we have found `/admin/admin.php` using `ffuf` to fuzz for content

Navigating to `/admin/admin.php` we have an error message which says **"Admins only!"**, meaning i am a lower privileged user and i need to login as an higher privilege user to view this page

Tried out **HTML injection** and yeah the vulnerability exists, so we have potential **XSS** and **SQLI** since the content of message got reflected on the web page, We can the decide to intercept request with burp, save the request and pass it to `sqlmap` to see if it is possible

Manual testing still beats all, i tried using the `/capstone?message=` parameter and my **SQLI** kept failing, but clicking on **add rating** on one of the items and checking things out the **SQLI** and **XSS** truly exist there

**Note :** if the comment `#` doesn't work try `-- -` , took me long enough to figure this out


Now we can intercept this particular request with `burp` and pass it to ``
