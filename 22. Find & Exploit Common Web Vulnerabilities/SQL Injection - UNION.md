We can check if **SQLI** is possible by using this query -  `admin' OR 1=1#` or `admin' OR 1=1-- -` and here is the output

Since we don't know how many **columns** exists on this table we could use the `UNION` query to query for information we need

```
admin' union select null,null,null#
```

**_Where :_**

>`admin` is likely an attempt to target a user or role named "admin" in the database.
  `union` is used to combine the result of the injected query with the original query.
  `select null, null, null` is an attempt to retrieve three columns of data. The null values here may be placeholders, and an attacker would typically replace them with actual data or malicious code.
4. `#` is used to comment out the rest of the query, effectively ignoring any text that follows it.

The hope of the attacker is that the original SQL query being executed allows the injection to be successful, resulting in the attacker gaining access to or retrieving data from the database.
