## **Overview**

This vulnerability do not provide immediate or direct feedback to the attacker about the success or failure of their malicious actions. In other words, the attacker is "blind" to the results of their actions because they do not receive immediate feedback or error messages that would typically indicate whether their attack was successful or not.
