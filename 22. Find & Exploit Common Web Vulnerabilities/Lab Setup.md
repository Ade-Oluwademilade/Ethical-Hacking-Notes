**We need to setup our own lab on docker in other to run attacks on a safe environment ðŸ¤Ÿ**

```bash
$ sudo apt update

$ sudo apt upgrade

$ sudo apt install docker.io

$ sudo apt install docker-compose
```

**RESTART YOUR VM**

Copy the labs to a directory in your system, then open a terminal to that directory

```shell
$ tar -xf peh-web-labs.tar.gz

$ cd labs

$ sudo docker-compose up
```


> The first time it runs, it will need to download some things, it may take a while depending on your internet connection. Next time you run it though, it will be much faster.

Once you see the databases are **ready for connections** the containers should be ready to go.
